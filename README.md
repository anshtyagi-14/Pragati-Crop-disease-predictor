AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

## Overview

**Project Name:** AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System  
**Track:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development   

---

## Problem Statement

The slow and inaccurate detection of plant disease, which is currently based on manual observation. This method is time-consuming, liable to human error, and is frequently not able to detect disease at early stages—resulting in lower crop yield and loss of money to farmers. 

### Objective

To develop an **AI-driven system** that uses crop images and environmental data to predict potential disease outbreaks and provide actionable insights. This system will help farmers identify and treat diseases early, improving yield and reducing losses.

## Solution Description

Our solution is an AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System, with the goal of transforming disease detection in agriculture. Contrary to traditional manual checks that are error-prone and time-consuming, our platform utilizes environmental data and AI to detect diseases at the early stage and provide customized interventions.

The USP is the integration of computer vision with real-time environmental information to enable more accurate, contextual, and timely predictions. The platform has an easy-to-use mobile and web application for accessibility, even in rural locations. It enables farmers to have control through alerts on disease, treatment options, and preventive measures without the necessity of in-depth technical skills.

### Key Features:
- AI-based disease detection via image upload
- Integration with environmental and soil data
- Real-time disease alerts and notifications
- Tailored treatment and prevention plans
- Farmer-friendly multilingual UI
- Mobile and web application support
- Offline data caching for poor connectivity
- User history and crop diary for analytics


### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** React Native for mobile, ReactJS for web
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Machine Learning:** Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for training and deploying disease detection models
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing crop data, images, and environmental data
- **Cloud Services:** AWS for hosting the models and managing environmental data

## Expected Outcome

- **Increased Crop Yield:** By detecting diseases early, farmers can take preventive measures and increase productivity.
- **Cost Reduction:** Early detection and timely intervention reduce the cost of disease treatment.
- **Scalability:** The system is scalable for use across different regions and crops, making it widely applicable.
